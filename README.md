# Houdini_USD_Tools_Temporary
Some USD tools and setups made for houdini.
These tools and setups are made to simplify USD workflow and bring them into a full usd pipeline (repository regarding this is coming soon). 

You can find the source code in each corresponding folder, and the HDAs in the main "HDA" folder. 

These tools will evolve through time, this repository is temporary.
